Hi, welcome to the osu project org! Community Tournaments. Here we create cool overlays for your osu tournaments!

Who do I mean when I talk about these kinds of overlays?
- [4 Digit Catch World Cup 2022](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1587766984)
- [Russian osu! Cup 2022](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1625212582)
- [Indonesia Convert Cup Open 2022](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1649711958)
- [Masters Open CIS Tournament 2023](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1800907815)

Interested? If you want a similar overlay, we can make it for you!<br/>
*How do I contact us to negotiate a price and what will be required?*<br/><br/>
### For now, the only way is to add `crIDax#2328` to discord indicating that you want to order the overlay
